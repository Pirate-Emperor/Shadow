# Shadow

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Shadow  
**Author:** Pirate-Emperor

## Description

Shadow is a versatile repository developed by Pirate-Emperor that focuses on generating shadow maps from various lunar models, including Lunar_ISR, Crater_Detection, Height_Map, DTM_3D, and Hazard_Map. This project combines the outputs of these models to create detailed shadow maps of the lunar terrain. Shadow maps are essential for understanding lighting conditions, studying surface features, and enhancing the realism of lunar exploration simulations.

## Models Integration

Shadow integrates the following models to derive shadow maps:

1. **Lunar_ISR:** Enhances the resolution of lunar images to provide clearer details.
2. **Crater_Detection:** Identifies and outlines impact craters on the lunar surface.
3. **Height_Map:** Generates high-resolution lunar height maps for accurate topographic information.
4. **DTM_3D:** Estimates the depth information of lunar terrain from 2D images.
5. **Hazard_Map:** Identifies potential hazards on the lunar surface.

## Features

1. **Comprehensive Shadow Mapping:** Shadow combines the outputs of various models to create comprehensive shadow maps, capturing the intricate details of lunar surface features.

2. **Customizable Lighting Conditions:** Researchers and users can adjust parameters to simulate different lighting conditions for shadow map generation.

3. **Integration Support:** Shadow provides APIs and integration support for seamless incorporation into lunar exploration applications and simulations.
